# rxr-redux-example
RxR and Redux side by side to learn the principles.

_2016-07-22:_ published source code (without comments, yet) of example in RxR. There are actions (messageStreams), reducers and even async loading. But no Redux code to compare with, yet, and no docs.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Read the [Specs](./specs/SPECS.md) to know what we are building :)

Leave feedback in issues - about anything.

Any enhancements of the code - RxR or Redux (once it will be there) are welcome! We are learning together.
