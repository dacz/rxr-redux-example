# Let's go

I want to show similarities with Redux app (and how easy it can be rewritten with RxR - RxJS). I do not want to diminish value of Redux at all - I like Redux and I like RxJS. It inspires me and it's up to the project and personal preference to choose the right direction and tool for every project. With RxR you are very very close to Redux so you are not trapped in some different approach.

RxR is here to encourage you to learn (and try to use) [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs). RxJS is great. Really.

Let's go through the app.
