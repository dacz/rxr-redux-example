# What we want to build

## Specification

Create one-page application with list of clients and their details. Clients data are stored in 'clients.json' which will be loaded dynamically via http request.

## Wireframe description:
* **Clients list:** Every item will display smaller avatar clients name and job title. When user clicks on an item, it will display client's details on the right.
* **Search:** It will search all informations, not only those showed in the clients list. Results are displayed as filtered out list of clients and they will appear instantly as user types.
* **Client's details:** Full size avatar (128x128px) and all other client's informations.
